        <h2>Unethical Practices in Science</h2>
        <p class="description">Science is built on the foundation of truth, rigor, and the pursuit of knowledge for the
          betterment of humanity. But even in this noble field, the line between discovery and deception is sometimes
          crossed. When ethical standards are ignored, the consequences can be profoundâ€”affecting lives, eroding public
          trust, and damaging the credibility of the scientific community itself.

          Unethical practices in science include:

          Data Fabrication and Falsification: Deliberately altering or inventing research results to fit a desired
          outcome. This undermines the reproducibility of science and leads others down false paths.

          Plagiarism: Stealing ideas, text, or results without proper attribution not only disrespects fellow
          researchers but also creates a false image of originality.

          Exploitation in Research: History has seen vulnerable populations used in experiments without consent or
          compensation, often under the guise of progress. The Tuskegee Syphilis Study and experiments on prisoners or
          marginalized groups serve as haunting reminders.

          Conflict of Interest: When financial or personal interests influence a scientist's work, it compromises
          objectivity. Biased results driven by funding sources, especially from industries with a stake in outcomes,
          can mislead the public and policymakers.

          Suppression of Unfavorable Results: Ignoring or hiding data that doesn't support a hypothesisâ€”or a sponsor's
          goalsâ€”is intellectually dishonest and harmful to real progress.

          Ethics in science isnâ€™t optional. It's essential. Without it, we risk turning discovery into damage, and
          curiosity into exploitation.

          The modern scientific community is working to strengthen safeguards: ethics review boards, open peer review,
          whistleblower protections, and transparent data sharing. But it also falls on individual researchers to uphold
          the integrity of their work.</p>
